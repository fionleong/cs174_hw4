0001_Composer_Autoloader

We have the code for composer's autoloader, but we were unable to test the code to see if it was working. We had tried to run the demo code Professor Pollett has provided but we were still unable to his or our code without getting an error message. We have installed composer in our computer and ran it on termial, it said its running. However when we try again to run the demo code and the same error message appeared. At this point we just commented out the require_once "vendor/autoload.php"; and proceed to work on the other parts of the site. Madhuri was in charged of working on setting up composer autoloader.
